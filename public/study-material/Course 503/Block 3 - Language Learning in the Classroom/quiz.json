      "correct_answer": "Metaphor",
      "page_reference": 8,
      "explanations": {
        "Simile": "Incorrect. Simile compares two things using connecting elements like 'as' or 'like' (e.g., 'as pretty as moon').",
        "Metaphor": "Correct. A metaphor identifies unlike objects with each other to underscore a similarity without using 'like' or 'as'.",
        "Alliteration": "Incorrect. Alliteration refers to the repetition of the same consonant or vowel sounds in a line.",
        "Personification": "Incorrect. Personification involves representing nature or animals as human beings."

      "question": "According to the sources, why are reference books like dictionaries and encyclopedias NOT considered 'true literature'?",
      "options": [
        "Because they do not provide detailed information.",
        "Because they lack aesthetic and universal dimensions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Because they lack aesthetic and universal dimensions.",
      "page_reference": 21,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Informative literature provides very detailed and complete information.",
        "Option 2": "Correct. True literature (Creative/Imaginative) must have social, aesthetic, and universal dimensions; informative texts lack the latter two.",
        "Option 3": "Incorrect. The authorship does not determine the classification; the objective and dimension of the text do.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. While some may be difficult, the primary reason is their lack of aesthetic qualities."

      "page_reference": 25,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. The source notes that even if the hero is a child, the ideas might be too complex for a child to understand (e.g., 'Idgah').",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. Poetry, a major form of literature, is cited as being the most difficult to translate.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. Language and ideas need to be at a level that is accessible to the age of the children in the class.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. Literature can and should challenge imagination and develop sensitivity, but it must remain accessible."

      "correct_answer": "Grammar translation method",
      "page_reference": 42,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. This model replaced literature teaching between 1940-1960 focus on utility.",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. This method assumes children have innate abilities and should be helped through challenging texts.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. The grammar translation method relied on rote paradigms and translation between the first and target languages.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. This is a format for using literature in a class, not a historical pedagogical method."

        "Lesson plans are only used by teachers with weak subject knowledge.",

      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. The unit emphasizes the distinction between simple teaching and structured lesson planning.",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. Even teachers with strong subject holds make mental session plans; formal planning is for effective upbringing of children.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. Planning must relate the context of day-to-day living to the lesson to make learning effective.",

      "question": "According to the sources, why is it acceptable for a child to use their home language (like Bhojpuri) in a school classroom?",
      "options": [
        "Because it is easier for the teacher to grade.",
        "Because the child should be allowed to use languages they know in the early stages.",
        "Because it helps children avoid learning the standard medium of instruction.",

      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Grading is not the primary reason cited.",
        "Option 2": "Correct. The text explicitly states that children must be allowed to use their home languages in the early stages to facilitate growth.",
        "Option 3": "Incorrect. The goal is to move progressively toward the standard language, not avoid it.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. Textbooks are often in a standard language (like Hindi), but the pedagogy allows for L1 use."

        "Option 2": "Incorrect. Teachers should not simply strike out answers with red ink.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. Teachers should analyze why the child made the mistake and plan to remove the error from the knowledge base.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. Completion of the syllabus without specific learning objectives being realized is considered useless."

      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. This is a TLM because children have access to it and use it to think.",
        "Option 2": "Correct. If children are to stay away from it for fear of damage, it is a teaching aid used only by the teacher.",
        "Option 3": "Incorrect. This is a TLM because children interact with and use it to construct knowledge.",
