      "question": "How do linguists generally define language according to the sources?",
      "options": [
        "A means of communication used by ordinary people.",
        "A pairing of a grammar and a dictionary.",
        "A biological instinct with no structural rules.",
        "A static set of rules that exists before speakers."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A pairing of a grammar and a dictionary.",
      "page_reference": 8,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. This is how 'ordinary people' recognize language, not the specific definition attributed to linguists in the text.",
        "Option 2": "Correct. The text states that linguists generally look at language as a pairing of a grammar and a dictionary.",
        "Option 3": "Incorrect. While humans have an innate faculty, linguists see language as having organized structural levels (sounds, words, grammar).",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. The source emphasizes that there is no language without speakers and that grammars cannot be made unless speakers exist first."

      "question": "In the Hindi sound system, what is the rule for a word starting with a consonant cluster beginning with the sound /p/?",
      "options": [
        "It can cluster with any other consonant in the Hindi alphabet.",
        "It can only cluster with vowels, never other consonants.",
        "It can only cluster with /y/, /r/, /l/, and /v/.",
        "It must be followed by at least two vowels."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "It can only cluster with /y/, /r/, /l/, and /v/.",
      "page_reference": 19,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. The text provides specific phonological rules that restrict combinations; not all consonants can cluster.",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. Consonant clusters exist in Hindi, as shown in the examples like 'smriti'.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. Rule 1 states that if a word starts with a cluster where the first consonant is /p/, it can only cluster with /y, r, l, v/.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. The rule pertains to the consonants following /p/ in a cluster, not the number of vowels."

      "question": "Which of the following describes the 'holophrastic' stage in child language acquisition?",
      "options": [
        "The stringing together of vowels like 'uuuu' and 'iiii'.",
        "The use of a single word to function as a whole phrase or sentence.",

      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. This describes the 'Cooing' stage which occurs around 6 weeks.",
        "Option 2": "Correct. The one-word stage is called holophrastic because a single word (like 'mam mam') expresses a complex thought or request.",
        "Option 3": "Incorrect. This describes the 'Telegraphic' stage which occurs during the two-word stage or later.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. This describes 'Babbling' which occurs around 6 to 10 months."

      "question": "What is the primary function of 'Learning' (conscious knowledge) in Krashen’s theory of Second Language Acquisition?",
      "options": [
        "It is responsible for initiating all utterances and ensuring fluency.",
        "It acts as a 'Monitor' or editor to make changes after an utterance is produced.",
        "It is the only way children acquire their first language at home.",

      "page_reference": 174,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Acquisition, not learning, 'initiates' utterances and is responsible for fluency.",
        "Option 2": "Correct. Krashen states that Learning has only one function: as a Monitor or editor to check and correct form.",
        "Option 3": "Incorrect. First language is 'acquired' subconsciously in a natural environment, not 'learnt' through conscious rules.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. The text emphasizes that acquisition through communication is still vital for second language proficiency."

    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "According to the sources, why is the process of language standardization often associated with social exploitation?",
      "options": [
        "Because it makes the language too difficult for anyone to speak.",
        "Because the variety chosen as 'standard' is usually the one spoken by those with political and corporate power.",
        "Because dictionaries and grammars are expensive to produce.",
        "Because it forces all speakers to learn at least five different dialects."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Because the variety chosen as 'standard' is usually the one spoken by those with political and corporate power.",
      "page_reference": 33,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Standardization aims for a uniform variety, not necessarily an impossible one.",
        "Option 2": "Correct. The sources state that standardization is related to exploitation because those with power make the decisions on which variety is 'standard'.",
        "Option 3": "Incorrect. While dictionaries are mentioned as part of the process, the 'exploitation' aspect refers to power dynamics.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. Standardization usually promotes one variety over others, rather than forcing the use of many dialects."

      "question": "What does the 'Dichotic Listening Test' demonstrate regarding language processing in the brain?",
      "options": [
        "That the right hemisphere is the primary language center for most people.",
        "That humans hear different languages better in their left ear.",
        "That the left hemisphere is the language center for the majority of people.",
        "That both hemispheres process sounds at the exact same speed."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "That the left hemisphere is the language center for the majority of people.",
      "page_reference": 139,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. The right hemisphere is generally not the language center; sounds sent there take longer to process as they must travel to the left hemisphere.",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. Most people repeat words played in the right ear more accurately because it connects directly to the left hemisphere.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. The test shows that words from the right ear are processed faster because they go directly to the left hemisphere (the language center).",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. The test proves there is a delay when sounds are processed by the non-language-dominant hemisphere."

        "Option 2": "Incorrect. The count increased past 18 with the 92nd amendment in 2003.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. Through various amendments (21st, 71st, and 92nd), the total reached 22 scheduled languages.",

      "correct_answer": "Broca’s area",
      "page_reference": 140,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Damage to Wernicke's area is associated with problems in speech 'comprehension'.",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. The brain stem controls basic life functions like breathing and heartbeats.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. The text explicitly states that damage to Broca's area causes problems in speech production.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. For most, the right hemisphere is not the primary center for speech production."

      "page_reference": 145,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Cooing and babbling start early, but the critical period for full acquisition is much longer.",
        "Option 2": "Correct. The critical period is described as a time (roughly 2-14 years) set by nature for effortless acquisition.",
        "Option 3": "Incorrect. After this period (puberty), language acquisition becomes more difficult, especially pronunciation.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. This is a biological/developmental phase, not a school-based timeframe."

      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. English is usually the second or third language in this formula.",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. Hindi is only the first language if it is the mother tongue/regional language of that state.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. The formula states the first language should be the mother tongue or regional language.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. Sanskrit is often chosen as a classical language but not generally the 'first' language."

        "Option 1": "Incorrect. The text states that both have their own grammar and are rule-governed.",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. Any language can be written in any script; script is not a defining linguistic factor.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. Linguistically, there is no difference; the distinction is social and political, based on power.",

      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. This occurs much later in development.",
        "Option 2": "Correct. It is called telegraphic because it lacks 'little words' (postpositions, auxiliary verbs) and focuses on words carrying meaning.",
        "Option 3": "Incorrect. This describes the babbling stage.",

        "Option 3": "Correct. These are examples of how the environment and culture influence the development of a regional variety of English.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. While influenced by local languages, they are creative coinages (like 'prepone') rather than just 'wrong' translations."

      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. They often knew 'went' earlier; the change indicates a new cognitive step, not memory loss.",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. Adults rarely say 'goed'; the child creates this form based on a rule.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. The use of 'goed' is evidence that the child has discovered the '-ed' rule and is applying it logically (over-generalization).",
