      "question": "In the Hindu-Arabic decimal system, why is the digit '0' specifically referred to as a 'place holder'?",
      "options": [
        "Because it is the smallest whole number and begins every count.",
        "Because its value changes depending on which column it occupies.",
        "Because it keeps the place of a specific power of ten intact to give proper identity to a number.",
        "Because it is the only digit that does not have a face value."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Because it keeps the place of a specific power of ten intact to give proper identity to a number.",
      "page_reference": 3,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Counting starts from 1, and while 0 is the smallest whole number, this does not define its role as a place holder.",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. The text states that '0' has the same place value (zero) regardless of its position.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. The source explains that without 0, a number like 308 would reduce to 38, causing confusion; 0 keeps the position intact.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. Every digit has a face value; the face value of 0 is 0."

      "page_reference": 6,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. This is true; natural numbers (1, 2, 3...) are a subset of integers.",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. This is true; integers can be written as p/1, fitting the rational number definition.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. The source explicitly states that 'Zero (0) is neither positive nor negative.'",

      "question": "In Geometry, why are 'Point', 'Line', and 'Plane' referred to as 'Undefined terms'?",
      "options": [
        "Because mathematicians haven't agreed on what they mean yet.",
        "Because their definitions would require using the very terms they are trying to define.",
        "Because they do not exist in the physical world.",
        "Because they are only used in 2-D shapes and not 3-D objects."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Because their definitions would require using the very terms they are trying to define.",
      "page_reference": 42,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Mathematicians have agreed on their usage via axioms, even if the terms themselves are technically 'undefined'.",
        "Option 2": "Correct. The text states that to define these basic terms, one would have to come back to the terms themselves, hence they are 'Undefined'.",
        "Option 3": "Incorrect. While they are abstract, they are the foundation for defining physical shapes.",

      "question": "According to the source, why should 'non-standard units' like hand-spans or sticks be used before standard units like meters?",
      "options": [
        "Because standard units are too expensive for primary schools to purchase.",
        "Because non-standard units are more accurate for small children's measurements.",
        "Because they are familiar to children and help them realize the necessity for a standard, uniform scale.",

        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Cost is not the pedagogical reason given.",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. Non-standard units are actually less accurate because they vary by person.",

      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Area is a 'derived' unit, not a base unit.",
        "Option 2": "Correct. The SI system includes seven base units, with length, mass, and time being three of the primary ones used in school.",
