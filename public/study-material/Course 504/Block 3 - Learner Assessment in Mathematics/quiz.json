      "correct_answer": "The Content Principle",
      "page_reference": 3,
      "explanations": {
        "The Learning Principle": "Incorrect. The **Learning Principle** focuses on assessment enhancing mathematics learning and supporting good instructional practice.",
        "The Equity Principle": "Incorrect. The **Equity Principle** states assessment should support every student’s opportunity to learn important mathematics and avoid being a filter used to deny students opportunities.",
        "The Content Principle": "Correct. According to the sources, the **Content Principle** mandates that assessment reflects the mathematics most important for students to learn and be able to do.",
        "The Coherence Principle": "Incorrect. **Coherence** is a criterion for assessment (not a fundamental principle) requiring that assessment fits together, matches its purpose, and aligns with the curriculum."

      "explanations": {
        "Abstract to Concrete to Contextual": "Incorrect. This reverses the natural learning sequence of mathematics.",
        "Concrete-Contextual to Abstract": "Correct but incomplete. Mathematics assessment begins with **manipulation of concrete materials** and experiences and moves toward abstract concepts.",
        "Orality to Performance to Written": "Correct but incomplete. The process should begin with **oral assessment**, proceed to performance tasks, and finally to written tests using symbols.",
        "Both B and C are correct": "Correct. The sources state that the nature of assessment is **concrete-contextual to abstract** and moves from **orality to performance-activity to written**."

      "correct_answer": "Scrutiny",
      "page_reference": 11,
      "explanations": {
        "Comparison": "Incorrect. **Comparison** involves the learner comparing their performance with those of other learners in the class.",
        "Self-analysis": "Incorrect. **Self-analysis** is detecting omissions, repetitions, or mistakes in steps, formulas, or principles.",
        "Scrutiny": "Correct. **Scrutiny** occurs when a learner minutely scrutinizes the outcome after each step and against expected final outcomes.",
