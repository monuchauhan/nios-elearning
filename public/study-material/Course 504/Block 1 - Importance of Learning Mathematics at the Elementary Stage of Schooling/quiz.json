      "correct_answer": "Equilibration of assimilation and accommodation",
      "page_reference": 4,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Rote memorization is described as a mechanical process that often leads to math phobia rather than cognitive development.",
        "Option 2": "Correct. Piaget conceptualized thinking as reaching a balance (equilibration) between interpreting new events with existing structures (assimilation) and modifying structures (accommodation).",
        "Option 3": "Incorrect. While perception is the base of thinking, the structure of the process of knowing specifically involves equilibration.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. Language is a vehicle of thought, but equilibration is the invariant internal mechanism for cognition."

        "Option 2": "Incorrect. This stage (2 to 7 years) is characterized by representation and symbolism but lacks reversible operations and conservation.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. Between age 7 and 11, children demonstrate 'Operations' allowing logical thought through physical manipulation of concrete objects.",

      "page_reference": 11,
      "explanations": {

      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. This describes the deductive reasoning process.",
        "Option 2": "Correct. Inductive reasoning is the basic process by which children make sense of the world by classifying experiences into structured concepts.",
        "Option 3": "Incorrect. Humans actually have a limited working memory capacity, which is a separate feature of information processing.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. While textbooks use it, most textbook problems focus on the application of formulas (Deductive)."
