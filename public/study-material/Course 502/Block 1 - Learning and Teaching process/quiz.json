    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "According to the text, what fundamentally distinguishes observational learning from simple imitation?",
      "options": [
        "Imitation requires more cognitive rehearsal than observational learning.",
        "Observational learning is the exact reproduction of a model's behavior.",
        "Observational learning involves thinking, judging, and understanding potential consequences.",
        "Imitation is only used by children to learn language."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Observational learning involves thinking, judging, and understanding potential consequences.",
      "page_reference": 11,
      "explanations": {
        "Imitation requires more cognitive rehearsal than observational learning.": "Incorrect. The source states that observational learning is more complex because it requires cognitive representation, storage, and mental rehearsal.",
        "Observational learning is the exact reproduction of a model's behavior.": "Incorrect. The text explicitly says learning through observation is NOT the exact reproduction of a model’s behavior.",
        "Observational learning involves thinking, judging, and understanding potential consequences.": "Correct. The text defines observational learning as a process where we think and judge the consequences of our actions rather than just copying.",
        "Imitation is only used by children to learn language.": "Incorrect. While it is a key method for children to learn language, imitation is also used for cultural norms and behaviors throughout life."
      }

    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which factor describes developmental changes that are relatively independent of environmental influence and are closely related to heredity?",

        "Maturation",
        "Motivation",
        "Socialization"

      "correct_answer": "Maturation",
      "page_reference": 5,
      "explanations": {
        "Learning": "Incorrect. Learning is shaped primarily by an individual's interaction with the immediate environment.",
        "Maturation": "Correct. Maturation describes changes that are relatively independent of environmental influence and assumed to be closely related to heredity.",
        "Motivation": "Incorrect. Motivation is an internal or external force that sustains and directs activity toward a goal.",
        "Socialization": "Incorrect. Socialization is heavily dependent on environment and interaction, whereas maturation is biological."

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "In a 'teacher-dominated' classroom, what is the primary role of the students?",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "To be passive and obedient to the teacher's instructions.",
      "page_reference": 3,
      "explanations": {
        "To be co-constructors of knowledge.": "Incorrect. This describes the Constructivist Approach, where students build their own knowledge.",
        "To be passive and obedient to the teacher's instructions.": "Correct. In traditional teacher-dominated settings, the teacher plans everything and students are expected to be passive and obedient.",
        "To actively plan classroom activities.": "Incorrect. This is a hallmark of Learner-Centered or Activity-Based approaches.",
        "To use trial and error to discover concepts.": "Incorrect. Trial and Error is a specific learning process, but teacher-dominated classrooms focus on transmitting fixed facts rather than discovery."

      "explanations": {
        "Extrinsic Motivation": "Incorrect. This involves performing an activity to attain an external outcome, such as grades or avoiding punishment.",
        "Intrinsic Motivation": "Correct. This motivation exists within the individual and is based on taking pleasure in the activity itself, resulting in high-quality learning and creativity.",
        "Vicarious Reinforcement": "Incorrect. This refers to imitating behavior because someone else was observed being rewarded for it.",
        "Social Reinforcement": "Incorrect. This is a form of external reward (praise) often used to strengthen imitations."

      "explanations": {
        "Attention Process": "Incorrect. This involves focusing on the significant features of the behavior to be learned.",
        "Retention Process": "Correct. Retention is the ability to store information as visuals in memory and mentally rehearse sequences.",
        "Motor Reproduction Process": "Incorrect. This is the transformation of mental rehearsals into physical practice and actions.",
        "Motivational Process": "Incorrect. This refers to the necessity of having an incentive or self-motivation to perform the learned behavior."

      "page_reference": 13,
      "explanations": {
        "Law of Exercise": "Incorrect. This law states that repetition of an activity helps a student retain it longer.",
        "Law of Readiness": "Incorrect. This law states that learning is effective only when the student is prepared physically and mentally.",
        "Law of Effect": "Correct. This law states that behavior followed by satisfying consequences is learned easily, while those followed by annoying states are forgotten.",
        "Law of Disuse": "Incorrect. This is a component of the Law of Exercise where lack of use weakens a connection."

      "explanations": {
        "Passive reception from the teacher.": "Incorrect. The approach assumes knowledge is NOT passively received from the environment.",
        "Active construction by the student based on adaptation.": "Correct. Knowledge is built by students as they adapt to and modify their experiences of the world.",
        "Memorization of bit-sized facts.": "Incorrect. This describes 'Banking Education' in traditional teacher-centered models.",
        "Strict adherence to textbook exercises.": "Incorrect. This describes the Subject-Centered approach."

        "Sensorimotor (0–2 years)": "Incorrect. Intelligence is related to motor activities and immediate sensory experiences.",
        "Pre-operational (2–7 years)": "Incorrect. Children in this stage generally show an inability to conserve quantity despite changes in form.",
        "Concrete Operations (7–11/12 years)": "Correct. It is during this stage that children realize quantity remains the same despite form changes.",
        "Formal Operations (11/12–15 years)": "Incorrect. This stage involves abstract and hypothetical thinking beyond concrete objects."

      "page_reference": 23,
      "explanations": {
        "Applying a painful stimulus to stop behavior.": "Incorrect. This is the definition of punishment, which Skinner differentiates from reinforcement.",
        "Removing an unpleasant stimulus to strengthen behavior.": "Correct. Negative reinforcement provides relief by removing an aversive stimulus to strengthen desired behavior.",
        "Providing a reward like praise or high grades.": "Incorrect. This is positive reinforcement.",
        "Ignoring a student to stop an undesirable behavior.": "Incorrect. While ignoring (extinction) can be used, it is not the definition of negative reinforcement."

        "It is a final proven fact.": "Incorrect. A hypothesis is a tentative idea that must be tested and verified.",
        "It is a possible solution formulated based on the nature of the problem.": "Correct. Problem solving involves formulating and testing hypotheses to reach a solution.",
        "It is a set of instructions given by the teacher.": "Incorrect. Hypotheses are generated by the student as they analyze and synthesize a problem.",
        "It is a memorized rule from the textbook.": "Incorrect. Traditional subject-centered learning uses textbooks, but problem solving encourages critical thinking over memorization."

      "page_reference": 20,
      "explanations": {
        "Some have better memory capacity.": "Incorrect. While memory is related, the text specifically attributes perception differences to a combination of experience and purpose.",
        "Perception is a function of previous experiences, assumptions, and needs.": "Correct. We assign meanings to what we perceive based on our past experiences and our current purposes.",
        "The teacher has not provided the correct meaning yet.": "Incorrect. In the 'Meaning Making' context, the student is the creator of meaning, not the teacher.",
        "They are not following the prescribed syllabus.": "Incorrect. Traditional syllabus-driven teaching assumes all students see objects the same way, but meaning-making contradicts this."

        "Salivation in response to food": "Incorrect. This is the unconditioned response (UCR).",
        "The bell/buzzer after pairing with food": "Correct. The bell becomes the conditioned stimulus (CS) after repeated pairing with the unconditioned stimulus.",
