        "It can lead to demoralization and loss of self-confidence in weaker students": "The primary disadvantage is that labeling students as 'weak' can adversely affect their self-confidence and motivation.",

      "page_reference": 61,
      "explanations": {
        "The state recruitment policy is based on Pupil-Teacher Ratio (PTR)": "Recruitment is based on ratios (e.g., 1 teacher per 40 students). If a school has 80 students across 5 grades, it gets only 2 teachers, making multi-grade teaching necessary.",
        "Teachers prefer multi-grade teaching": "Multi-grade situations are often a challenging necessity due to resources, not a teacher's preference.",
        "The RTE Act prohibits more than one teacher": "The RTE Act actually mandates a specific number of teachers based on admitted children (e.g., 5 teachers for 121-200 children).",

        "Classes sitting separately facing separate blackboards": "Facing away from other grades and toward separate blackboards helps minimize distraction and facilitates separate oral work.",
