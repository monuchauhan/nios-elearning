      "page_reference": 34,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. This describes 'Measurement', which focuses specifically on quantitative description.",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. This describes 'Assessment', which is the collection of data relative to goals.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. Evaluation involves bringing meaning to collected data through interpretation and reflection to make a judgment.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. While standardized tests are a tool, they do not define the holistic process of evaluation."

      "correct_answer": "Formative Assessment",
      "page_reference": 45,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Summative assessment 'sums up' development at a particular time, usually for grading/ranking at the end of a course.",
        "Option 2": "Correct. Formative assessment is an on-going process used during instruction to monitor progress and provide feedback in a non-threatening environment.",
        "Option 3": "Incorrect. Norm-referenced assessment compares a student's performance against a group norm or standard rather than focusing on individual growth feedback.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. Standardized testing is typically used for large-scale summative purposes and is not intended for daily classroom feedback."

        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Assessment OF learning usually occurs at the end of a unit to judge the product of learning.",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. While similar, Assessment FOR learning is primarily teacher-led to modify instruction.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. Assessment AS learning is entirely student-controlled, where students utilize assessment criteria to monitor and improve their own learning process.",
        "Option 4": "Incorrect. Summative evaluation is a product-oriented process at the terminal stage, not a learning-process tool for students."

        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Summative assessment occurs at the end of learning, not before it starts.",
        "Option 2": "Correct. Diagnostic assessment is made before learning commences to determine what a student does and does not know.",
        "Option 3": "Incorrect. Placement evaluation is the beginning of instruction for placement, whereas diagnostic is for identifying gaps in current learning.",

      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Restricted response items control the length, content, or scope of the answer.",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. Objective items limit responses to a single word, number, or selection.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. Extended response items permit students to decide which facts are most pertinent and select their own style of organization.",

      "page_reference": 226,
      "explanations": {
        "Option 1": "Incorrect. Open-ended items are actually harder to score because they have multiple correct paths.",
        "Option 2": "Incorrect. Closed-ended (objective) items have definite answers; open-ended items do not.",
        "Option 3": "Correct. Open-ended items create scope for assessing if a student is able to draw meaning rather than just reciting memorized facts.",
