      "page_reference": 11,
      "explanations": {
        "The use of high-tech laboratory equipment.": "Incorrect. While equipment is used, it is not the philosophical distinction between science and non-science.",
        "The ability to make claims that are based purely on observation.": "Incorrect. While logical positivists grounded science in observation, Popper argued the central feature was falsifiability.",
        "The ability to make falsifiable claims that can be proven false in principle.": "Correct. Popper argued that science aims at falsifiable claims, distinguishing it from non-science.",
        "The reliance on ancient scripts and dogmatic beliefs.": "Incorrect. Dogmatic beliefs are held in the absence of evidence and are contrasted with scientific knowledge."

        "Natural Law": "Incorrect. Natural law generalizes observations and explains what always happens in certain circumstances, but doesn't interpret them like a theory.",
        "Fact": "Incorrect. A fact is something that really occurred and is independent of the observer.",
        "Theory": "Correct. A theory is an accepted hypothesis that summarizes a group of hypotheses supported by repeated testing.",

      "page_reference": 12,
      "explanations": {
        "The person must have a belief that is true and have evidence/reasons for that truth.": "Correct. Plato’s definition requires three criteria: the student must have a belief, the belief must be true, and they must have evidence or reasons for it.",
        "The person must have read the information in a reliable textbook.": "Incorrect. Relying on a book is not enough; the knower must personally have the evidence.",
        "The person must have a strong emotional desire for the information to be true.": "Incorrect. Knowledge should be objective and undistorted by emotion.",
        "The person must have achieved 'know-how' through physical skill acquisition.": "Incorrect. 'Know-how' refers to skills; Plato's definition specifically addresses 'knows that' (propositional knowledge)."
