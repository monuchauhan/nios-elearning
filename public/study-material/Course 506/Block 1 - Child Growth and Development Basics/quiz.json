      "question": "Which of the following statements best describes the distinction between growth and development?",
      "options": [
        "Growth refers to qualitative changes in character, while development refers to increase in physical size.",
        "Growth is a continuous process from conception to death, whereas development stops at maturity.",
        "Growth refers to structural and physiological changes, while development is concerned with both growth and behavioral changes resulting from the environment.",
        "Development is measurable in terms of weight and height, while growth is not totally observable."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Growth refers to structural and physiological changes, while development is concerned with both growth and behavioral changes resulting from the environment.",
      "page_reference": 3,
      "explanations": {
        "Growth refers to qualitative changes in character, while development refers to increase in physical size.": "Incorrect. This reverses the definitions; growth is quantitative (size) and development is qualitative (character).",
        "Growth is a continuous process from conception to death, whereas development stops at maturity.": "Incorrect. The sources state that growth stops with maturity, while development continues throughout the lifespan.",
        "Growth refers to structural and physiological changes, while development is concerned with both growth and behavioral changes resulting from the environment.": "Correct. Growth refers to structural/physical changes, while development is an inclusive term addressing maturation and behavioral changes.",
        "Development is measurable in terms of weight and height, while growth is not totally observable.": "Incorrect. Growth is the aspect that is measurable in weight and height, while qualitative development is not totally observable."

      "page_reference": 4,
      "explanations": {
        "The head to the limbs (longitudinal axis).": "Incorrect. This describes the 'cephalo-caudal' direction, not proximodistal.",
        "The center of the body to the periphery.": "Correct. Proximodistal direction means development proceeds from the center of the body toward the extremities/periphery.",
        "General responses to specific activities.": "Incorrect. While true of development generally, this is a separate principle, not the definition of proximodistal.",
        "The womb to the tomb.": "Incorrect. This refers to the principle of 'Continuous Development'."

      "page_reference": 16,
      "explanations": {
        "Emotions are expressed only in the presence of concrete objects.": "Incorrect. This is a trait of early childhood emotions, but later childhood also sees emotions expressed in the absence of concrete objects.",
        "Emotions are long-lasting and stable.": "Incorrect. Emotions in early childhood are temporary and shift rapidly (e.g., weeping to happy with a toffee).",
        "Emotional expressions are intense regardless of the intensity of the stimulus.": "Correct. In early childhood, emotional expressions are intense irrespective of how strong the actual trigger was.",
        "Children become very skilled at hiding their true emotions.": "Incorrect. Children in this stage generally fail to hide emotions and express them through activities like crying or nail-biting."
