      "page_reference": 3,
      "explanations": {
        "A chronological record of kings": "Incorrect. While history often includes records of kings, the Greek root 'Historia' specifically means the process of finding out information.",
        "Enquiry, research, or exploration": "Correct. According to the sources, the word 'History' comes from the Greek noun 'Historia' which means enquiry, research, exploration, or information.",
        "The biography of great men": "Incorrect. This is Thomas Carlyle's 1895 definition of history, not the etymological root.",
        "A scientific study of the past": "Incorrect. This is a modern definition of history provided by Prof. Ghose, whereas the question asks for the original Greek meaning."

      "explanations": {
        "Herodotus": "Incorrect. Herodotus is known as the 'Father of History' and wrote about the Greco-Persian wars.",
        "Aristotle": "Incorrect. Aristotle was a native of Greece and a teacher of Alexander, but the source credits others with developing the discipline of history.",
        "Thucydides": "Correct. Thucydides developed the subject on scientific lines, writing about the Peloponnesian wars purely on the basis of evidence and showing causal relationships.",
        "Ernest Bernheim": "Incorrect. Bernheim provided a highly regarded definition of history as a science in 1889, but Thucydides is the ancient figure credited with this approach."

        "Because it embodies systematized knowledge based on realities and occurrences rather than myth.": "Correct. Bernheim defines it as a science because it is based on the realities of life and happenings that actually took place, not imagination or myth.",

        "Actual history is recorded in books, while known history is oral tradition.": "Incorrect. Both can involve written and oral records; the distinction is about the volume of events vs. what we have evidence for.",
        "Actual history is everything that occurred, while known history is only the scanty evidence left behind.": "Correct. Actual history is everything that happened at the time and place, while known history is smaller because evidence is often lost as people die or artifacts decay.",
        "Known history is objective, while actual history is subjective.": "Incorrect. The source implies the known past is simply a smaller subset of the actual facts.",

        "History moves in circles, following the rise, peak, and fall of civilizations.": "Correct. The cyclical view conveys that history moves in a circle, with civilizations rising to a peak and then moving downward until they disappear."
